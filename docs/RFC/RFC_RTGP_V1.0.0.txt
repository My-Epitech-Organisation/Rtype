1.  Introduction

   The R-Type Game Protocol (RTGP) is a lightweight, binary,
   datagram-oriented protocol designed to facilitate real-time
   multiplayer gameplay.  It prioritizes low latency and bandwidth
   efficiency while providing a selective reliability mechanism (RUDP)
   to ensure critical game events are delivered without the overhead
   of TCP.

2.  Terminology & Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   2.1.  Data Types

      Byte:    8-bit unsigned integer.
      uint16:  16-bit unsigned integer.
      uint32:  32-bit unsigned integer.
      float:   32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
      String:  NOT SUPPORTED in standard packets to avoid allocation
               overhead, unless specified in the payload.

   2.2.  Byte Order

      All multi-byte numeric fields MUST be transmitted in Network Byte
      Order (Big-Endian).  Implementations on Little-Endian
      architectures (x86/x64) MUST convert data before transmission
      (htons, htonl) and after reception (ntohs, ntohl).

3.  Transport Layer

   Protocol:      UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
   Default Port:  4242.
   MTU Safety:    The total packet size (Header + Payload) SHOULD NOT
                  exceed 1400 bytes to avoid IP fragmentation on
                  standard networks.

4.  Packet Structure

   Every RTGP packet consists of a fixed 16-byte Header followed by a
   variable-length Data Payload.

   4.1.  Header Format

     |                                                               |
     /                        Data Payload ...                       /
     |                                                               |

   Field Definitions:

   Magic Byte:   uint8. MUST be 0xA1. Used to filter spurious traffic.

   Packet Type:  uint8. The Operation Code (OpCode) defined in Sec 5.

   Packet Size:  uint16. Length of the Data Payload in bytes. Excludes
                 Header size.

   User ID:      uint32. The sender's unique identifier.

   Sequence ID:  uint16. Incremental ID of the packet sent. Wraps at
                 65535.

   Ack ID:       uint16. The Sequence ID of the last packet
                 successfully received.

   Flags:        uint8. Bitmask for packet attributes (see 4.3).

   Reserved:     3 bytes. Padding for 16-byte alignment. MUST be 0.

   4.2.  User ID Conventions

   Server Authority:  0xFFFFFFFF (-1). Only the Server uses this.
   Unassigned Client: 0x00000000. Used during handshake.
   Assigned Client:   0x00000001 to 0xFFFFFFFE.

   4.3.  Reliability Mechanism (Flags)

   The Flags field is used to manage the reliability layer (RUDP).

   Flag Bitmask Values:

      0x01 (RELIABLE): The sender requests an acknowledgement for this
           packet. The receiver MUST acknowledge this packet (either
           via a dedicated ACK or piggybacking).

      0x02 (IS_ACK): The Ack ID field in this header is valid and
           acknowledges a previously received packet.

   Behavior:

   1. Sequence ID: MUST be incremented by 1 for every new packet sent.
   2. Ack ID: MUST always contain the Sequence ID of the last valid
      packet received from the remote peer.
   3. Retransmission: If a packet marked RELIABLE is not acknowledged
      within a specific timeout (e.g., 200ms), the sender MUST
      retransmit it.

         Description: Correction of client position (anti-drift).
         Payload: Authoritative X (float), Authoritative Y (float).

6.  Security Considerations

   1. Header Validation: Any packet where Header[0] != 0xA1 MUST be
      silently dropped.

   2. Sequence Validation: Packets with a Sequence ID significantly
      older than the last received ID SHOULD be discarded to prevent
      replay attacks and processing old state.

   3. Spoofing Protection: The Server MUST verify User ID against
      IP/Port.

   4. Authority Check: Clients MUST ignore packets claiming to be
      0xFFFFFFFF (Server) if they do not originate from the known
      Server IP endpoint.

7.  Future Extensions

   Ping/Pong: OpCodes 0xF0 (Ping) and 0xF1 (Pong) reserved for latency
   calculation.

   Packet Fragmentation: Not currently supported. Payloads exceeding
   MTU must be handled at the application logic level or split into
   multiple entities.
