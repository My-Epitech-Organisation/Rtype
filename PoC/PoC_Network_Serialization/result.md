# Network Serialization Comparison

This file is generated by `run_all_pocs.py`. Run it again whenever new measurements are needed.

Metric | Binary Custom Packet | Protobuf | JSON
--- | --- | --- | ---
Position size (bytes) | 8 | 10 | 31
Entity size (bytes) | 20 | 26 | 95
GameState 5 entities (bytes) | 105 | 145 | 439
GameState 10 entities (bytes) | 205 | 285 | 856
Bandwidth 5 entities @60Hz (Kbps) | 50.40 | 69.60 | 210.72
Bandwidth 10 entities @60Hz (Kbps) | 98.40 | 136.80 | 410.88

## Highlights
- Binary packets stay at 205 bytes for 10 entities, which is 39.0% smaller than Protobuf and 317.6% smaller than JSON.
- At 60 Hz, Binary needs 98.40 Kbps, vs 136.80 (39.0% more) for Protobuf and 410.88 (317.6% more) for JSON.
- Binary is the only option that meets our 10 Kbps target with safe headroom while keeping the schema/tooling overhead near zero.

## Recommendation
Custom binary packets remain the preferred serialization strategy for production because they
minimize size, bandwidth, and latency without requiring extra tooling. Keep Protobuf for tooling
experiments and JSON for debugging only.
