# Accessibility: Slow Mode, Reaction-Time Support & UI Clarity

## 1. Problem Statement

R-Type is a fast-paced side-scrolling shooter. However, players with slower reaction times or certain cognitive or motor disabilities may struggle to keep up. This document analyzes how to introduce a **Slow Mode** or time-scaling mechanism, and how to improve UI clarity for better readability and reduced photosensitivity risks.

---

## 2. Scope

### Game Speed Modifiers

* Investigate whether the engine can globally scale **DeltaTime** to slow down the entire game loop without breaking physics or animations.
* Decide between a **Global Time Scale** variable vs. per-system scaling.

### UI Clarity & Photosensitivity Safety

* Research best practices for accessible UI elements (icons, fonts, readability).
* Define rules to avoid rapid flashes or strong visual strobing.

---

## 3. Requirements

### Functional

* Player must be able to enable a **Slow Mode** (e.g., 50% speed).
* Slow Mode must scale: movement, firing rates, enemy speed, animations.
* UI elements must remain readable and uncluttered.

### Non-Functional

* Time scaling must not cause game-breaking inconsistencies.
* UI must follow accessibility guidelines for contrast, font size, and motion safety.

---

## 4. Global Time Scale Prototype Logic

A **GlobalTimeScale** parameter allows the game to run slower or faster by multiplying DeltaTime.

### Proposed Architecture

* Central **Time System** storing:

  * `float GlobalTimeScale = 1.0f;`
  * `float GetScaledDeltaTime() { return RawDeltaTime * GlobalTimeScale; }`

### Pseudocode

```
GlobalTimeScale = config.slow_mode_enabled ? 0.5f : 1.0f;
scaled_dt = raw_dt * GlobalTimeScale;

UpdatePlayer(scaled_dt);
UpdateEnemies(scaled_dt);
UpdateProjectiles(scaled_dt);
UpdateAnimations(scaled_dt);
```

### Edge Cases

* Projectile lifetimes and cooldown timers must also scale.
* UI animations should remain unscaled to avoid sluggish usability.

## 5. Difficulty Settings Strategy

Based on GlobalTimeScale, propose difficulty presets:

* **Normal:** TimeScale = 1.0
* **Slow Mode:** TimeScale ≈ 0.5 — beginner or accessibility mode
* **Custom:** Player-defined slider from 0.3 to 1.0

These settings can be stored via Config:

```json
{
  "accessibility": {
    "time_scale": 0.5
  }
}
```

## 6. UI Clarity Guidelines

Clear UI helps players with slower reaction times better process information.

### Iconography

* Use simple, silhouette-based icons.
* Avoid color-only distinctions (add shape cues).

### Fonts

* Minimum font size: **16–18 px** at 1080p.
* Use sans-serif fonts with high readability.
* Maintain WCAG-compliant contrast ratios: **4.5:1 minimum**.

### Layout

* Ensure predictable layout (persistent UI panels).
* Avoid clutter and motion behind text.

### Photosensitivity & Epilepsy Safety

**Avoid:**

* Flashing lights above **3 flashes per second**.
* High-intensity strobing.

**Use:**

* Smooth fades instead of rapid blinks.
* Contrast-based highlight instead of flashing.

## 7. Validation Strategy

* Test gameplay with TimeScale at 0.3, 0.5, 0.75.
* Ensure no physics breaks or AI timing desynchronization.
* Conduct UX tests with slow-reaction players.
* Run photosensitivity validation using automated strobe detectors.

## 8. Deliverables

* **GlobalTimeScale prototype logic** (pseudocode + architecture).
* **UI Style Guide** focused on clarity and accessibility.
* **Difficulty Mode Strategy** based on time scaling.

## 9. Conclusion

Supporting players with slower reaction times improves overall accessibility and provides a smoother onboarding experience. Implementing a Global TimeScale, combined with clean UI design and photosensitivity safeguards, allows the game to offer an accessible and inclusive experience.
